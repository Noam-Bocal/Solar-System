    <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known object in the universe that supports life. This is made possible by the fact that Earth has a lot of water, making it a water world and the only planet in the Solar System that has liquid surface water. The majority of Earth's water is found in its global ocean, which covers 70.8% of the planet's crust, while the remaining 29.2% is land. The land is mostly in the form of continental landmasses located in Earth's land hemisphere. Most of the land has vegetation cover and is somewhat humid. However, large sheets of ice in Earth's polar regions retain more water than all of Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust is made up of slowly moving tectonic plates that interact to create mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. The planet also has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere that protects it from the damaging effects of solar winds and cosmic radiation.

    <h3>Formation</h3>
    <p>
        The oldest material discovered in the Solar System dates back to 4.5682+0.0002−0.0004 billion years ago. By 4.54±0.04 billion years ago, the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies within the Solar System evolved with the Sun. According to the nebular theory, a solar nebula forms a volume out of a molecular cloud through gravitational collapse. This volume starts to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets form out of that disk along with the Sun. A nebula consists of gas, ice grains, and dust that include primordial nuclides. Planetesimals, according to nebular theory, formed by accretion, and it took an estimated 70 to 100 million years for the primordial Earth to form.

        The Moon's age estimates range from 4.5 billion years to significantly younger. A leading hypothesis is that it formed from material dislodged from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, known as Theia, collided with Earth. Theia hit Earth with a glancing blow, and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 billion years ago, the Late Heavy Bombardment caused numerous asteroid impacts that caused significant changes in the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.

        After formation
    </h3>
    <p>
        Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing. Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets. Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed. In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity.

        By 3.5 billion years ago, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind. An artist's impression of Early Earth shows its tinted orange methane-rich early atmosphere.

        As the molten outer layer of Earth cooled, it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust. The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4 billion years ago, only 140 million years after Earth's formation.

        There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance. The first model suggests a relatively steady growth up to the present day, which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally. The second model suggests an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists, which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.

        New continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At approximately 750 million years ago, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia at 600–540 million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180 million years ago.

        The most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago, and then intensified during the Pleistocene era about 3 million years ago. High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000, and 100,000 years. The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the "last ice age," covered large parts of the continents, to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.
