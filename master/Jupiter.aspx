    <p>
        Jupiter, the largest planet in our Solar System, is a gas giant that orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and has a mass over two and a half times greater than all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since prehistoric times. The planet is named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.

        Jupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System had a significant impact on the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter's composition is primarily hydrogen (90% by volume) and helium, which makes up a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. Jupiter's internal structure is believed to consist of an outer mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen, and a diffuse inner core of denser material. The planet's ongoing contraction generates more heat than it receives from the Sun. Due to its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, Jupiter's shape is an oblate spheroid, with a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator.

        Jupiter's outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most notable result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier.

        Formation and migration
    </h2>
    <p>
        Jupiter is considered to be the oldest planet in our Solar System. It formed around one million years after the Sun, which makes it approximately 50 million years older than Earth. Current models of Solar System formation suggest that Jupiter formed at or beyond the "snow line." This is a distance from the early Sun where the temperature was cold enough for volatiles such as water to condense into solids. Jupiter started as a solid core and then accumulated its gaseous atmosphere. As a result, the planet must have formed before the solar nebula was entirely dispersed.

        During Jupiter's formation, its mass gradually increased until it had 20 times the mass of Earth. About half of that mass was made up of silicates, ices, and other heavy-element constituents. When Jupiter grew larger than 50 Earth masses, it created a gap in the solar nebula. The growing planet then reached its final mass in 3-4 million years. Jupiter is made of the same elements as the Sun, which are hydrogen and helium. Some scientists believe that the Solar System might have been a system of multiple protostars in its early formation, with Jupiter being the second but failed protostar. However, the Solar System never developed into a system of multiple stars, and Jupiter today does not qualify as a protostar or brown dwarf since it does not have enough mass to fuse hydrogen.

        According to the "grand tack hypothesis," Jupiter began to form at a distance of roughly 3.5 AU (520 million km; 330 million mi) from the Sun. As the young planet accreted mass, interaction with the gas disk orbiting the Sun and orbital resonances with Saturn caused it to migrate inward. This upset the orbits of several super-Earths orbiting closer to the Sun, causing them to collide destructively. Saturn would later have begun to migrate inwards at a faster rate than Jupiter, until the two planets became captured in a 3:2 mean motion resonance at approximately 1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi) from the Sun. This changed the direction of migration, causing them to migrate away from the Sun and out of the inner system to their current locations. All of this happened over a period of 3-6 million years, with the final migration of Jupiter occurring over several hundred thousand years. Jupiter's migration from the inner solar system eventually allowed the inner planets, including Earth, to form from the rubble.

        There are several unresolved issues with the grand tack hypothesis. The resulting formation timescales of terrestrial planets appear to be inconsistent with the measured elemental composition. It is likely that Jupiter would have settled into an orbit much closer to the Sun if it had migrated through the solar nebula. Some competing models of Solar System formation predict the formation of Jupiter with orbital properties that are close to those of the present-day planet. Other models predict Jupiter forming at distances much farther out, such as 18 AU (2.7 billion km; 1.7 billion mi).

        According to the Nice model, the infall of proto-Kuiper belt objects over the first 600 million years of Solar System history caused Jupiter and Saturn to migrate from their initial positions into a 1:2 resonance. This caused Saturn to shift into a higher orbit, disrupting the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, depleting the Kuiper belt, and triggering the Late Heavy Bombardment.

        Based on Jupiter's composition, researchers suggest that it initially formed outside the molecular nitrogen (N2) snow line, estimated at 20-30 AU (3.0-4.5 billion km; 1.9-2.8 billion mi) from the Sun and possibly even outside the argon snowline, which may be as far as 40 AU (6.0 billion km; 3.7 billion mi). Having formed at one of these extreme distances, Jupiter then migrated inwards to its current location over a period of roughly 700,000 years, during an epoch approximately 2-3 million years after the planet began to form. In this model, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune would have formed even further out than Jupiter, and Saturn would also have migrated inwards.

        Physical characteristics
    </h2>
    <p>
        Jupiter is a gas giant, which means that its primary chemical composition is hydrogen and helium. These materials are classified as gases in planetary geology, a term that does not indicate the state of matter. Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System with a diameter of 142,984 km (88,846 mi) at its equator, giving it a volume 1,321 times that of the Earth. Its average density, 1.326 g/cm3, is lower than that of the four terrestrial planets.
