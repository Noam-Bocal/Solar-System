    <p>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is known as "the Red Planet" due to its orange-red surface, which is covered in iron(III) oxide dust. Its high-contrast albedo features make it a popular object for telescope viewing and it's classified as a terrestrial planet. With a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi), it is the second smallest planet in the Solar System. A Martian solar day (sol) is equivalent to 24.5 hours, while a Martian solar year is equivalent to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days). Mars has two small and irregularly shaped natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos.

        Natural history
    </h2>
    <p>
        Scientists have proposed that Mars was formed as a result of a random process of collecting material from the protoplanetary disk, which orbited the Sun during the Solar System's formation. Mars has unique chemical features caused by its position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulfur, are much more abundant on Mars than on Earth. These elements were probably pushed outward by the Sun's energetic solar wind when it was young.

        After the planets were formed, the inner Solar System may have experienced the so-called Late Heavy Bombardment. Roughly 60% of Mars's surface shows a record of impacts from that period, while much of the remaining surface is probably underlain by immense impact basins caused by those events. However, recent modeling has questioned the existence of the Late Heavy Bombardment. There is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the Northern Hemisphere of Mars, spanning 10,600 by 8,500 kilometers, or roughly four times the size of the Moon's South Pole-Aitken basin. If confirmed, it would be the largest impact basin discovered yet. It has been hypothesized that the basin was formed when Mars was struck by a Pluto-sized body about four billion years ago. The event, believed to be the cause of the Martian hemispheric dichotomy, created the smooth Borealis basin, which covers 40% of the planet.

        A 2023 study shows evidence, based on the orbital inclination of Deimos (a small moon of Mars), that Mars may once have had a ring system 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. This ring system might have been created by a moon orbiting Mars billions of years ago that was 20 times more massive than Phobos, and Phobos would be a remnant of that ring.

        The geological history of Mars can be divided into many periods, but the following are the three primary periods:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Noachian period: The oldest extant surfaces of Mars formed 4.5 to 3.5 billion years ago. These surfaces are marked by many large impact craters. The Tharsis bulge, a volcanic upland, is believed to have formed during this period, with extensive flooding by liquid water late in the period. Named after Noachis Terra.</li>
        <li>Hesperian period: This period lasted from 3.5 to between 3.3 and 2.9 billion years ago. It was characterized by the formation of extensive lava plains. Named after Hesperia Planum.</li>
        <li>Amazonian period: This period lasted from 3.3 to 2.9 billion years ago to the present. Amazonian regions have few meteorite impact craters but are otherwise quite varied. Olympus Mons formed during this period, with lava flows elsewhere on Mars. Named after Amazonis Planitia.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Geological activity is still taking place on Mars. The Athabasca Valles is home to sheet-like lava flows created about 200 million years ago. Water flows in the grabens called the Cerberus Fossae occurred less than 20 million years ago, indicating equally recent volcanic intrusions. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has captured images of avalanches.

        Physical characteristics
    </h2>
    <p>
        Mars is a planet in our solar system that is approximately half the size of Earth. Despite being smaller, its surface area is only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, with only about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass. This means that its surface gravity is only about 38% of that on Earth.

        Mars is the only known desert planet, with a rocky surface that is similar to the hot deserts on Earth. The planet appears red-orange in color due to the presence of ferric oxide, also known as rust. Depending on the minerals present on its surface, Mars can also appear in other colors such as golden, brown, tan, and greenish.
