    <p>
        Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi) and one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.

    <h2>Composition</h2>
    <p>
        Mercury is one of the four rocky planets in our solar system, including Earth. It is the smallest planet, with a radius of 2,439.7 km, making it smaller than the largest natural satellites in our solar system, such as Ganymede and Titan. The planet is made up of about 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.

        Mercury's internal structure consists of a solid silicate crust and mantle, covering a solid metallic outer core and a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. While the composition of Mercury's iron-rich core remains uncertain, it is believed to contain nickel, silicon, and possibly sulfur and carbon, along with trace amounts of other elements. With a density of 5.427 g/cm3, Mercury has the second-highest density in our solar system, just slightly less than Earth's density of 5.515 g/cm3. If we factor out the effect of gravitational compression from both planets, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser than those of Earth, with an uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth's 4.4 g/cm3. Mercury's high density is due to a large and iron-rich core, which is not as compressed as Earth's core, despite the planet's smaller size.
