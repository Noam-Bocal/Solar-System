    <p>
        Neptune is the eighth planet in our Solar System and is the farthest from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in terms of diameter and the third-most massive planet, making it the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times heavier than Earth and is slightly more massive than the ice giant Uranus. The planet is smaller in size than Uranus, but it is denser due to the gravitational compression of its atmosphere caused by its greater mass. Neptune has no well-defined solid surface and is mainly composed of gases and liquids. It orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units, which is equivalent to 4.5 billion kilometers or 2.8 billion miles. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol  that represents Neptune's trident.

        Atmosphere
    </h2>
    <p>
        At high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is composed of 80% hydrogen and 19% helium, with a trace amount of methane. Methane absorbs red light at wavelengths above 600 nm, which gives Neptune its faint blue hue. This hue is more pronounced than Uranus's due to concentrated haze in Uranus's atmosphere.

        Neptune's atmosphere is divided into two main regions: the lower troposphere and the stratosphere. In the troposphere, temperature decreases with altitude, while in the stratosphere, temperature increases with altitude. The boundary between the two regions, known as the tropopause, lies at a pressure of 0.1 bars (10 kPa). The stratosphere then leads to the thermosphere, which gradually transitions to the exosphere at a pressure lower than 10−5 to 10−4 bars (1 to 10 Pa).

        Moons
    </h2>
    <p>
        Neptune, the eighth and furthest known planet from the Sun has a total of 16 moons. Triton, the largest moon of Neptune, is responsible for over 99.5% of the mass that orbits around Neptune and is the only one that is massive enough to be spheroidal. Triton was discovered 17 days after the discovery of Neptune by William Lassell. Unlike other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit that suggests it was captured by Neptune rather than forming in place. It was likely once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. Triton is slowly spiralling inward towards Neptune due to tidal acceleration and will eventually be torn apart in about 3.6 billion years when it reaches the Roche limit. In 1989, Triton was the coldest object ever measured in the Solar System, with an estimated temperature of 38 K (-235°C). This low temperature is due to Triton's high albedo, which causes it to reflect a lot of sunlight instead of absorbing it.

        Neptune's second-known satellite, Nereid, has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the Solar System. Its eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an apoapsis that is seven times its periapsis distance from Neptune.

        From July to September 1989, Voyager 2 discovered six moons of Neptune. Proteus, an irregularly shaped moon, is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity. Although it is the second-most-massive Neptunian moon, it is only 0.25% the mass of Triton. Neptune's innermost four moons, Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea, orbit close enough to be within Neptune's rings. Larissa, the next-farthest out, was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring arcs, but when Voyager 2 observed Neptune in 1989, Larissa was found to have caused it. In 2004, five new irregular moons were discovered between 2002 and 2003. The smallest moon, Hippocamp, was found in 2013 by combining multiple Hubble images. Neptune's moons are named after lesser sea gods because Neptune was the Roman god of the sea.
