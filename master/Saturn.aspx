 <p>
     Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is the second-largest in the Solar System, just behind Jupiter. It's a gas giant that's about nine-and-a-half times larger than Earth, though it has only one-eighth the average density of our planet. Despite its size, Saturn is over 95 times more massive than Earth. It's worth noting that although Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, its mass is less than one-third of Jupiter's. Saturn has an orbital period of 29.45 years and orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km).

 <h2>
     Physical characteristics
 </h2>
 <p>
     Saturn is a gas giant, mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. It does not have a definite surface, but it is believed to have a solid core at its center. Due to its rotation, Saturn has an oblate spheroid shape, which means it bulges at its equator and is flattened at the poles. Its equatorial radius is 10% larger than its polar radius, measuring 60,268 km and 54,364 km, respectively. The other gas giants in the Solar System - Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune - are also oblate, but to a lesser extent.

     The combination of Saturn's bulge and rotation rate causes its effective surface gravity along the equator to be 8.96 m/s2, which is 74% of what it is at the poles and lower than Earth's surface gravity. However, the equatorial escape velocity of nearly 36 km/s is much higher than that of Earth.

     Saturn is the only planet in the Solar System that is less dense than water, with an average specific density of 0.69 g/cm3 due to its atmosphere. Although Saturn's core is denser than water, its overall mass is 95 times that of Earth. Jupiter, on the other hand, has a mass 318 times that of Earth. Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.

 <h3>
     Atmosphere
 </h3>
 <p>
     Saturn's outer atmosphere is primarily made up of molecular hydrogen (96.3%) and helium (3.25%). However, the amount of helium is much lower than what is found in the Sun. The quantity of heavier elements in Saturn's atmosphere is not accurately known, but it is assumed that they match the primordial abundances that existed during the formation of the Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be between 19 and 31 times the mass of Earth, with a significant portion of it being present in Saturn's core.

     Saturn's atmosphere also contains trace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and methane. The upper clouds are made up of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, which leads to a series of chemical reactions with hydrocarbons. The resulting products are carried downwards by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is influenced by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.
