    <p>
        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this energy is emitted from its surface as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since ancient times.

    <h2>Composition</h2>
    <p>
        The Sun consists primarily of hydrogen and helium, with hydrogen accounting for about 74.9% of its mass in the photosphere, and helium about 23.8%. Other heavier elements, collectively known as metals in astronomy, make up less than 2% of the Sun's mass. Among these, oxygen comprises roughly 1%, carbon 0.3%, neon 0.2%, and iron 0.2% of the Sun's total mass in the photosphere.

        In solar research, scientists often express the abundance of each element in dex, a scaled logarithmic unit denoted as A(e) = 12 + log10(ne/nH), where 'e' represents the element in question, nH is the number of hydrogen atoms, and ne is the number of atoms of the element 'e'. By this definition, hydrogen has an abundance of 12, while helium's abundance varies between approximately 10.3 and 10.5 depending on the phase of the solar cycle. The abundances of other elements like carbon, neon, oxygen, and iron are also measured in dex.

        The Sun's original chemical composition was inherited from the interstellar medium from which it formed. Initially, it would have been about 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements. The hydrogen and most of the helium in the Sun are believed to have been produced during the Big Bang nucleosynthesis in the first 20 minutes of the universe's existence. Heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, neon, and iron were formed in previous generations of stars before the Sun's formation. These elements were then dispersed into the interstellar medium through events such as supernovae.

        Over its 4.6 billion years of existence, the Sun's main fusion process has involved converting hydrogen into helium. This process has gradually increased the proportion of helium within the Sun's core from about 24% to approximately 60% due to fusion reactions. Some of the helium and heavier elements have settled towards the center of the Sun's core due to gravity, while heat is transferred outward through radiation rather than convection.

        The chemical composition of the Sun's photosphere is typically considered representative of the primordial Solar System's composition. Measurements of solar heavy-element abundances are often done using spectroscopy of the Sun's photosphere and comparing them with abundances in meteorites that have not undergone melting. These meteorites are believed to retain the composition of the early Sun, unaffected by settling of heavy elements.
