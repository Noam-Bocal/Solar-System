    <p>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is classified as a gaseous ice giant with a cyan color. Most of the planet is composed of water, ammonia, and methane which are in a supercritical phase of matter, also known as 'ice' or volatiles in astronomy. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of all the Solar System's planets, measured at 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F). Uranus has a marked axial tilt of 82.23° with a retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.

        Atmosphere
    </h2>
    <p>
        Uranus does not have a well-defined solid surface within its interior. However, the outermost part of its gaseous envelope which can be accessed through remote sensing is referred to as its atmosphere. The remote-sensing capability can reach up to about 300 km below the 1 bar (100 kPa) level, with a corresponding pressure of around 100 bar (10 MPa) and a temperature of 320 K (47 °C; 116 °F). The tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar.

        The atmosphere of Uranus can be divided into three layers. The troposphere, which ranges from altitudes of −300 and 50 km (−186 and 31 mi) and pressures from 100 to 0.1 bar (10 MPa to 10 kPa); the stratosphere, which spans altitudes between 50 and 4,000 km (31 and 2,485 mi) and pressures of between 0.1 and 10−10 bar (10 kPa to 10 µPa); and the thermosphere, which extends from 4,000 km to as high as 50,000 km from the surface. There is no mesosphere present in Uranus.

    <h3>
        Composition
    </h3>
    <p>
        The atmosphere of Uranus is composed mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium, with a helium molar fraction of 0.15±0.03 in the upper troposphere. This means that the number of helium atoms per molecule of gas is 0.26±0.05. The mass fraction is close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of 0.275±0.01, which suggests that helium has not settled in the center of Uranus as it has in the gas giants. Methane is the third-most-abundant component of Uranus's atmosphere, which is responsible for its aquamarine or cyan color. Methane molecules account for 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the methane cloud deck at the pressure level of 1.3 bar (130 kPa).
        The mixing ratio of methane is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out. The abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere of Uranus are not well known but are likely to be higher than solar values. Uranus's stratosphere contains trace amounts of various hydrocarbons such as ethane, acetylene, methylacetylene, and diacetylene, which are produced from methane by photolysis induced by the solar ultraviolet radiation. Spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapor, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere, which can only originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets.

    <h2>
        Moons
    </h2>
    <p>
        Uranus has 28 natural satellites, all of which are named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope's works. The five main satellites are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Compared to other giant planets, Uranus has the smallest and least massive satellite system. The combined mass of Uranus's five major satellites is less than half that of Triton, which is the largest moon of Neptune.

        Titania is the largest of Uranus's satellites, with a radius of only 788.9 km, which is less than half that of the Moon but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn. Uranus's satellites are primarily composed of ice and rock conglomerates, with an ice content of around 50%, which may include ammonia and carbon dioxide. These satellites have relatively low albedos, ranging from 0.20 for Umbriel to 0.35 for Ariel in green light.

        Among the Uranian satellites, Ariel appears to have the youngest surface, with the fewest impact craters, while Umbriel has the oldest surface. Miranda has fault canyons 20 km deep, terraced layers, and a chaotic variation in surface ages and features. Miranda's past geologic activity is thought to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than it is currently, probably as a result of a former 3:1 orbital resonance with Umbriel. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are the likely origin of Miranda's "racetrack"-like coronae.

        Ariel is believed to have once been held in a 4:1 resonance with Titania. Uranus has at least one horseshoe orbiter, Crantor, occupying the Sun-Uranus L3 Lagrangian point, which is a gravitationally unstable region at 180° in its orbit. Crantor moves inside Uranus's co-orbital region on a complex, temporary horseshoe orbit. Another promising Uranus horseshoe librator candidate is 2010 EU65.
