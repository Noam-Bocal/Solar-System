    <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus is notable for having the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the surface it has a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. These conditions are extreme enough to compress carbon dioxide into a supercritical state close to Venus's surface.

    <h2>Physical characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        Venus is one of the four rocky planets in our Solar System. It is often referred to as Earth's twin because of its similar size and mass. Venus has a nearly spherical shape due to its slow rotation and its diameter is only slightly smaller than Earth's. However, Venus is the third smallest planet in our Solar System with a mass of 81.5% of Earth's. The planet's atmosphere is dense and consists of 96.5% carbon dioxide and 3.5% nitrogen. The surface pressure on Venus is 9.3 megapascals (93 bars) and the average surface temperature is extremely hot at 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). This high temperature is above the critical points of both major constituents, making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid consisting mostly of supercritical carbon dioxide and some supercritical nitrogen.

        Atmosphere and climate
    </h3>
    <p>
        Venus, the second planet from the Sun, has a very dense atmosphere that's mostly composed of carbon dioxide along with some trace gases. The planet's mass is 92 times that of Earth, and its surface pressure is about 93 times greater than that of Earth. The density of Venus is approximately 6.5% that of water. Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect, which has created an extremely hot surface temperature of at least 735 K (462 °C; 864 °F), making it hotter than Mercury. Venus's atmosphere contains noble gases in larger quantities than Earth's, but it lacks radiogenic argon which indicates that the planet had a major magmatism shutdown early in its history. Although Venus's surface is not hospitable to Earth-like life, some scientists speculate that life could exist in the upper cloud layers. Unlike Earth, Venus's surface temperature does not vary much between its two hemispheres despite its slow rotation. Thick clouds made mainly of sulfuric acid reflect about 70% of the sunlight that falls on them back into space, located above the dense CO2 layer.
